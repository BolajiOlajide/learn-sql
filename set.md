# SET OPERATIONS

Set operations allow you to perform different tasks on separate table or datasets, you can use these operations to combine
all to one dataset.
There are 4 types of set operations:

- UNION
- UNION ALL
- INTERSECT
- EXCEPT

**UNION** and **UNION ALL** combine data from multiple tables into one dataset.
**INTERSECT** produces a row or rows that contain values that are common to both sets of data.
**EXCEPT** produces a result set or rows of values that exist in the first set but not the second.
